# Windows Customization
Hello guys. You know, Windows is limiting everything. But with external apps, we can do anything. This is a guide for it. Let's get started.

# Operating System
I recommend using Windows 10 LTSC, but you can use any version of Windows 10.

# Download Apps
|Apps|Reason to Use|Link|
|-|-|-|
|TranslucentTB|We want taskbar as transparent|[Link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pf4kz2vn4w9?hl=tr-TR&gl=TR)|
|TaskbarX (Portable version `^1`)|Taskbar should be in center of the screen|[Link](https://chrisandriessen.nl/taskbarx)|
|Lively Wallpaper `^2`|Animated wallpaper|[Link](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntm2qc6qws7?hl=en-US&gl=US)|
|Rainmeter|Desktop applets|[Link](https://www.rainmeter.net)|
|Simplicity Circles `^3`|System usage with circles|[Link](https://visualskins.com/skin/simplicity-circles)|
|Reflect Sound Visu `^3`|Visual music|[Link](https://visualskins.com/skin/reflect-sound-visu)


`^1` App is paid in Microsoft Store but we can use Portable Version for free. You can use Rainmeter version too, but I could not use it with TranslucentTB.
`^2` You can use Wallpaper Engine if you have, but it's paid. So we're using Lively Wallpaper, a free alternative.
`^3` Rainmeter skin. You should have Rainmeter to use them.

# Install Apps
## TranslucentTB
You installed it via Microsoft Store, so open it and go to system tray. Right click TranslucentTB and select `Maximized Window => Enabled` and right click TranslucentTB again, `Maximized Window => Blur`. And make sure `Open at boot` is enabled.

## TaskbarX
You downloaded a `.zip` file. Extract it, put it to a folder. I recommend `C:\Portable\TaskbarX`. And, open another file manager window and type `shell:startup` to address bar. Move `TaskbarX.exe` file to `shell:startup` while pressing `ALT`. And run `TaskbarX.exe`.

## Lively Wallpaper
You installed it via Microsoft Store, so open it and select a wallpaper for your liking.

## Rainmeter (and skins)
Open `.exe` file (rainmeter installer) and install it. Some skins will load, right click them and unload. And, install Simplicity Circles and Reflect Sound Visu by opening them. And you can position them for your liking.

# Conclusion
Now, your Windows is looking like a charm.
